The temple started initially as a thatched hut where Murugan's ardent devotee Annaswami Nayakar kept a portrait of the God and worshipped him. The temple was built on the same site as the thatched hut around 1890. He was the founder and the first priest of the temple. The Vadapalani temple became famous because of the Arul Vaakku and the ability to foretell events, as Annaswami Nayakar's words carried the truth. The devotees believed his sacred words gave effective solutions to problems, including education, failure in examinations, marriage issues, ailments, and unemployment, among others. The disciple of Annaswami Nayakar, Rathinasamy Chettiyar continued the tradition and had the same divine energy and ability as Arul Vaakku. The temple underwent renovation in 1920, and over the past century, devotees throng the temple in huge numbers.
